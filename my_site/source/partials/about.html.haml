  About Me
  %p
    I am venturing a new career as web developer, currently I am a Guest Lecturer in Linnaeus University-Vaxjo in Computer Science Department and
    currently teaching online at Al Madinah International University in Malaysia. I have been teaching Computer Science/IT subjects for
    15 years in different parts of the world which enabled her to learn different cultures, educational systems and pedagogical techniques.
    For now, she is concentrating on distance education and research about E-learning from assessing the readiness state to the Importance
    Performance Analysis and Service Quality Assurance. She has worked as Head of the Department of Computer Science where she experienced
    to develop Curriculum, Course Syllabi, Standard Procedures and Guidelines, Implementing Rules and Regulations etc. aligning to ISO standard.
    She is also interested to learn more about PBL because she believes that academicians should not only be good in the course content but
    also in the pedagogical aspects to encourage the learners to co-create and become active learners.
